# Shijima-Featured

### What is this?

This repository hosts list of shimeji that will appear when a user checks the Featured tab in [Shijima-iOS](https://havoc.app/package/shijima). This data is hosted on GitHub to automate updates and to make it easier for the community to contribute their own shimeji.

### I want to add my own shimeji to this list. How do I do it?

If you don't have one already, you will need to create a GitHub account to make a new submission. Make sure to review the [submission guidelines](submission_guidelines.md) first. Then, to submit your own shimeji to the Featured page, [open a new issue](https://github.com/pixelomer/Shijima-Featured/issues/new/choose).
