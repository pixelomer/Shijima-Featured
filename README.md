### What is this?

This repository hosts the list of shimeji that will appear when a user checks the Featured tab in [Shijima-iOS](https://havoc.app/package/shijima) and [Shijima-Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pixelomer.shijima). This data is hosted on GitHub to automate updates and to make it easier for community members to contribute their own shimeji.

### I want to add my own shimeji to this list. How do I do it?

Then, to submit your own shimeji to the Featured page, [open a new issue](https://github.com/pixelomer/Shijima-Featured/issues/new/choose).

### I want to get my shimeji removed. How do I do it?

You can [open a new issue](https://github.com/pixelomer/Shijima-Featured/issues/new/choose) to submit a removal request.
